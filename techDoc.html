            <header>Downloading and installing AutoHotKey.</header>
            <p>Before learning to use AutoHotkey (AHK), you will need to download it.<br>After downloading it, you may possibly need to install it.
            But that depends on the version you want.<br>
            For this guide we will use the Installer since it is easiest to set up.</p> 
            <p> Instructions : </p>
            <ol> 
                <li>Go to the AutoHotkey  <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">Homepage</a>.</li>
                <li>Click : <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe">Download</a></li>
                <li>During installation of AutoHotkey, you should choose UNICODE that provides better support options.</li>
                <li>Keep going until you see an Install button. Once done, you are good to go!</li>

            <header>How to create a script.</header>
            <p>If you want AutoHotkey to work its magic, you will have to give it instructions. It is called "Scripting".</p>
            <p> Instructions : </p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Right-Click on your desktop.</li>
                <li>Find "New" in the menu.</li>
                <li>Click "AutoHotkey Script" inside the "New" menu.</li>
                <li>Give the script a new name. It must end with a .ahk extension. For example: MyScript.ahk</li>
                <li>Find the newly created file on your desktop and right-click it</li>
                <li>Click "Edit Script".</li>
                <li>A window should have popped up, probably Notepad. If so, SUCCESS!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So now that you have created a script, we need to add stuff into the file.</p>
            <p>Here is a very basic script containing a hotkey which types text using the Send command when the hotkey is pressed:</p>
            <pre><code>^j::<br>Send, My First Script<br>return</code></pre>
            <ol>
                <li>The first line: <span>^j::</span> is the hotkey. <span>^</span>means Ctrl, <span>j</span> is the letter J. Anything to the left of <span>::</span> are the keys you need to press.</li>
                <li>The second line: <span>Send, My First Script</span> is how you send keystrokes. Send is the command, anything after the comma (,) will be typed.</li>
                <li>The third line: <span>return</span> This will become your best friend. 
                It literally stops code from going any further, to the lines below. 
                This will prevent many issues when you start having a lot of stuff in your scripts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You are almost there. Now :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save the File.</li>
                <li>Double-click the file/icon in the desktop to run it. Open notepad or (anything you can type in) and press Ctrl and J.</li>
                <li>Hip Hip Hooray! Your first script is done. Go get some reward snacks then return to reading the rest of this tutorial.</li>
            </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_difference_between_Hotkeys_and_Hotstrings.">
        <header>The difference between Hotkeys and Hotstrings.</header>
        <p>What is a hotkey? A hotkey is a key that is hot to the touch. ... Just kidding. It is a key or key combination that the person at the keyboard presses to trigger some actions. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>^j::<br>Send, My First Script<br>return</code></pre>
        <p>What is a hotstring? Hotstrings are mainly used to expand abbreviations as you type them (auto-replace), they can also be used to launch any scripted action. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>::ftw::Free the whales</code></pre>
        <p>The difference between the two examples is that the hotkey will be triggered when you press Ctrl+J while the hotstring will convert your typed "ftw" into "Free the whales".</p>
        <p>"So, how exactly does a person such as myself create a hotkey?" Good question. A hotkey is created by using a single pair of colons. The key or key combo needs to go on the left of the ::. And the content needs to go below, followed by a return.</p>
        <p>Note: There are exceptions, but those tend to cause confusion a lot of the time. So it won't be covered in the tutorial, at least, not right now.</p>
        <pre><code>Esc::<br>MsgBox, Escape!!!!<br>return</code></pre>
        <p>A hotstring has a pair of colons on each side of the text you want to trigger the text replacement. While the text to replace your typed text goes on the right of the second pair of colons.</p>
        <p>Hotstrings, as mentioned above, can also launch scripted actions. That's fancy talk for "do pretty much anything". Same with hotkeys.</p>
        <pre><code>::btw::<br>MsgBox, You typed btw.<br>return</code></pre>
        <p>A nice thing to know is that you can have many lines of code for each hotkey, hotstring, label, and a lot of other things we haven't talked about yet.</p>
        <pre><code>^j::<br>MsgBox, Wow!<br>MsgBox, There are<br>Run, notepad.exe<br>WinActivate, Untitled - Notepad<br>WinWaitActive, Untitled - Notepad<br>Send, 7 lines{!}{Enter}<br>SendInput, inside the CTRL{+}J hotkey.<br>return</code></pre>

        <header>What are those keys and their mysterious symbols?</header>
            <p>You might be wondering "How the crud am I supposed to know that ^ means Ctrl?!". Well, good question. To help you learn what ^ and other symbols mean, gaze upon this chart:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Symbol</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>#</td>
                    <td>Win (Windows logo key)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>!</td>
                    <td>Alt</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>^</td>
                    <td>Ctrl</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>+</td>
                    <td>Shift</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&</td>
                    <td>An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey.</td>
                </tr>
        
            </table>
            <p></p>
            <p>You can define a custom combination of two (and only two) keys (except controller buttons) by using  &  between them. In the example below, you would hold down Numpad0 then press Numpad1 or Numpad2 to trigger one of the hotkeys:</p>
            <pre><code>Numpad0 & Numpad1::<br>MsgBox, You pressed Numpad1 while holding down Numpad0.<br>return<br>Numpad0 & Numpad2::<br>Run, notepad.exe<br>return</code></pre>
            <p>But you are now wondering if hotstrings have any cool modifiers since hotkeys do. Yes, they do! Hotstring modifiers go between the first set of colons. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>:*:ftw::Free the whales</code></pre>

        <section class="main-section" id="Window_specific_hotkeys/hotstrings.">
            <header>Window specific hotkeys/hotstrings.</header>
            <p>Sometime you might want a hotkey or hotstring to only work (or be disabled) in a certain window. To do this, you will need to use either of these fancy commands with a # in-front of them:</p>
            <pre><code>#IfWinActive<br>#IfWinExist</code></pre>
            <p>These special commands (technically called "directives") create context-sensitive hotkeys and hotstrings. Simply specify a window title. But in some cases you might want to specify criteria such as HWND, group or class.</p>
            <pre><code>#IfWinActive Untitled - Notepad<br>#Space::<br>MsgBox, You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad.<br>return</code></pre>
            <p>To turn off context sensitivity for subsequent hotkeys or hotstrings, specify any #IfWin directive but leave all of its parameters blank. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>; Untitled - Notepad<br>#IfWinActive Untitled - Notepad<br>!q::<br>MsgBox, You pressed ALT+Q in Notepad.<br>return<br>; Any window that isn't Untitled - Notepad<br>#IfWinActive<br>!q::<br>MsgBox, You pressed ALT+Q in any window.<br>return</code></pre>
            <P>When #IfWin directives are never used in a script, all hotkeys and hotstrings are enabled for all windows.</P>
            <p>The #IfWin directives are positional: they affect all hotkeys and hotstrings physically beneath them in the script. They are also mutually exclusive; that is, only the most recent one will be in effect.</p>
            <pre><code>; Notepad<br>#IfWinActive ahk_class Notepad<br>#Space::<br>MsgBox, You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad.<br>return<br>::msg::You typed msg in Notepad<br>; MSPaint<br>#IfWinActive Untitled - Paint<br>#Space::<br>MsgBox, You pressed WIN+SPACE in MSPaint!<br>return<br>::msg::You typed msg in MSPaint!</code></pre>

            <header>Managing multiple Hotkeys/Hotstrings per file.</header>
            <p>This, for some reason crosses some people's minds. So I'll set it clear: AutoHotkey has the ability to have as many hotkeys and hotstrings in one file as you want. Whether it's 1, or 3253 (or more).</p>
            <pre><code>#i::<br>Run, https://www.google.com/<br>return<br>^p::<br>Run, notepad.exe<br>return<br>~j::<br>Send, ack<br>return<br>:*:acheiv::achiev<br>::achievment::achievement<br>::acquaintence::acquaintance<br>:*:adquir::acquir<br>::aquisition::acquisition<br>:*:agravat::aggravat<br>:*:allign::align<br>::ameria::America</code></pre>
            <p>The above code is perfectly acceptable. Multiple hotkeys, multiple hotstrings. All in one big happy script file.></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_send_keys_to_a_program?">
            <header>How to send keys to a program?</header>
            <p>So now you decided that you want to send (type) keys to a program. We can do that. Use the Send command. This command literally sends keystrokes, to simulate typing or pressing of keys</p>
            <p>But before we get into things, we should talk about some common issues that people have.</p>
            <p>Just like hotkeys, the Send command has special keys too. Lots and lots of them. Here are the four most common symbols:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Symbol</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>!</td>
                    <td>Sends Alt. For example, Send, This is text!a would send the keys "This is text" and then press Alt+A. Note: !A produces a different effect in some programs than !a. This is because !A presses Alt+Shift+A and !a presses Alt+A. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>+</td>
                    <td>Sends Shift. For example, Send, +abC would send the text "AbC", and Send, !+a would press Alt+Shift+A.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>^</td>
                    <td>Sends Ctrl. For example, Send, ^!a would press Ctrl+Alt+A, and Send, ^{Home} would send Ctrl+Home. Note: ^A produces a different effect in some programs than ^a. This is because ^A presses Ctrl+Shift+A and ^a presses Ctrl+A. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>#</td>
                    <td>Sends Win (the key with the Windows logo) therefore Send #e would hold down Win and then press E.</td>
                </tr>
        
            </table>
            <p>The gigantic table on the Send page shows pretty much every special key built-in to AHK. For example: {Enter} and {Space}.</p>
            <p>Caution: This table does not apply to hotkeys. Meaning, you do not wrap Ctrl or Enter (or any other key) inside curly brackets when making a hotkey.</p>
            <p>An example showing what shouldn't be done to a hotkey:</p>
            <pre><code>; When making a hotkey...<br>; WRONG<br>{LCtrl}::<br>Send, AutoHotkey<br>return<br>; CORRECT<br>LCtrl::<br>Send, AutoHotkey<br>return</code></pre>
            <p>A common issue lots of people have is, they assume that the curly brackets are put in the documentation pages just for fun. But in fact they are needed. It's how AHK knows that {!} means "exclamation point" and not "press Alt". So please remember to check the table on the Send page and make sure you have your brackets in the right places. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>Send, This text has been typed{!} ; Notice the ! between the curly brackets?<br> That's because if it wasn't, AHK would press the ALT key.</code></pre>
            <pre><code>; Same as above, but with the ENTER key. AHK would type out "Enter" if<br>; it wasn't wrapped in curly brackets.<br>Send, Multiple Enter lines have Enter been sent. ; WRONG<br>Send, Multiple{Enter}lines have{Enter}been sent. ; CORRECT</code></pre>
            <p>Another common issue is that people think that everything needs to be wrapped in brackets with the Send command. That is FALSE. If it's not in the chart, it does not need brackets. You do not need to wrap common letters, numbers or even some symbols such as . (period) in curly brackets. Also, with the Send commands you are able to send more than one letter, number or symbol at a time. So no need for a bunch of Send commands with one letter each. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>Send, {a}       ; WRONG<br>Send, {b}       ; WRONG<br>Send, {c}       ; WRONG<br>Send, {a}{b}{c} ; WRONG<br>Send, {abc}     ; WRONG<br>Send, abc       ; CORRECT</code></pre>
            <p>To hold down or release a key, enclose the key name in curly brackets and then use the word UP or DOWN. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>; This is how you hold one key down and press another key (or keys).<br>; If one method doesn't work in your program, please try the other.<br>Send, ^s                     ; Both of these send CTRL+S<br>Send, {Ctrl down}s{Ctrl up}  ; Both of these send CTRL+S<br>Send, {Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}<br>Send, {b down}{b up}<br>Send, {Tab down}{Tab up}<br>Send, {Up down}  ; Press down the up-arrow key.<br>Sleep, 1000      ; Keep it down for one second.<br>Send, {Up up}    ; Release the up-arrow key.</code></pre>
            <p>But now you are wondering "How can I make my really long Send commands readable?". Easy. Use what is known as a continuation section. Simply specify an opening parenthesis on a new line, then your content, finally a closing parenthesis on its own line</p>
            <pre><code>Send,<br>(<br>Line 1<br>Line 2<br>Apples are a fruit.<br>)</code></pre>
            <p>Note: There are several different forms of Send. Each has their own special features. If one form of Send does not work for your needs, try another type of Send. Simply replace the command name "Send" with one of the following: SendRaw, SendInput, SendPlay, SendEvent.</p>
